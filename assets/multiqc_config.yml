    section_name: "Binding Density"
    description:
      "The imaging unit only counts the codes that are unambiguously distinguishable. It simply will not count codes that overlap within an image.
      This provides increased confidence that the molecular counts you receive are from truly recognisable codes. Under most conditions, forgoing the few barcodes that do overlap will not impact your data.<br>
      Too many overlapping codes in the image, however, will create a condition called image saturation in which significant data loss could occur (critical data loss from saturation is uncommon).<br>
      To determine the level of image saturation, the nCounter instrument calculates the number of optical features per square micron for each lane as it processes the images. This is called the Binding Density (BD).
      The Binding Density is useful for determining whether data collection has been compromised due to image saturation. The acceptable range for Binding Density is:<br><br>
      <b>0.1 - 2.25</b> for MAX/FLEX instruments<br>
      <b>0.1 - 1.8</b> for SPRINT instruments<br><br>
      Within these ranges, relatively few reporters on the slide surface will overlap, enabling the instrument to accurately tabulate counts for each reporter species.
      A Binding Density significantly greater than the upper limit in either range is indicative of overlapping reporters on the slide surface.
      The counts observed in lanes with a Binding Density at this level may have had significant numbers of codes ignored, which could potentially affect quantification and linearity of the assay."

  FOV:
    id: FOV
    section_name: "FOV (Imaging)"
    description:
      "Each individual lane scanned on an nCounter system is divided into a few hundred imaging sections, called Fields of View (FOV), the exact number of which will depend on the system being used (i.e., MAX/FLEX or SPRINT), and the scanner settings selected by the user. <br>
      The system images these FOVs separately, and sums the barcode counts of all FOVs from a single lane to form the final raw data count for each unique barcode target.
      Finally, the system reports the number of FOVs successfully imaged as FOV Counted. <br><br>
      Significant discrepancy between the number of FOV for which imaging was attempted (FOV Count) and for which imaging was successful (FOV Counted) may indicate an issue with imaging performance.<br>
      Recommended percentage of registered FOVs (i.e., FOV Counted over FOV Count) is <b>75%.</b>"
  Posctrl_linearity:
    id: Posctrl_linearity
    section_name: "Positive Control Linearity"
    description: "Six synthetic DNA control targets are included with every nCounter Gene Expression assay. <br>
      Their concentrations range linearly (in codeset) from <b>128</b><it>fM</it> to <b>0.125</b><it>fM</it>, and they are referred to as <b>POS_A</b> to <b>POS_F</b>, respectively.<br>
      These Positive Controls are typically used to measure the efficiency of the hybridization reaction, and their step-wise concentrations also make them useful in checking the linearity performance of the assay.<br><br>
      Since the known concentrations of the Positive Controls increase in a linear fashion, the resulting counts should, as well."
  LOD:
    id: LOD
    section_name: "Limit Of Detection (LOD)"
    description:
      "The Limit Of Detection (LoD) is determined by measuring the ability to detect <b>POS_E</b>, the <b>0.5 fM</b> positive control probe, which corresponds to about 10,000 copies of this target within each sample tube. <br>
      On a FLEX/MAX system, the standard input of 100<it>ng</it> of total RNA will roughly correspond to about 10,000 cell equivalents (assuming one cell contains 10 <it>pg</it> total RNA on average). <br>
      An nCounter assay run on the FLEX/MAX system should thus conservatively be able to detect roughly one transcript copy per cell for each target (or 10,000 total transcript copies). <br>
      In most (codeset) assays, you will observe that even the <b>POS_F</b> probe (equivalent to <b>0.25</b> copies per cell) is detectable above background. Red dots mark outliers."
