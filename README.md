## Introduction

**nf-core/nanostring** is a bioinformatics pipeline that can be used to analyze NanoString data. The performed analysis steps include quality control and data normalization.

The pipeline is built using Nextflow, a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The Nextflow DSL2 implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from nf-core/modules in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources.The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the nf-core website.

## Pipeline summary

1. Quality control with NACHO ([`NACHO`](https://github.com/mcanouil/NACHO/))
2. Perform normalization with NACHO
3. Create count tables with provided metadata
4. Present QC for NanoString data ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Usage

> **Note**
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how
> to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline)
> with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
RCC_FILE,RCC_FILE_NAME,SAMPLE_ID,TIME,TREATMENT,INCLUDE,OTHER_METADATA
/path/to/sample1.RCC,sample1.RCC,sample1,1,0,1,your metadata
/path/to/sample2.RCC,sample2.RCC,sample2,2,0,1,your metadata
```

Each row represents a RCC file with counts.

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/nanostring \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> **Warning:**
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those
> provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/nanostring/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/nanostring/parameters).

## Pipeline output

To see the the results of a test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/nanostring/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.
